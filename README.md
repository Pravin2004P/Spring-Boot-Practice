## About The Project

This repository showcases the implementation of a microservices architecture using Spring Boot. It likely demonstrates how to build independent, loosely coupled services that communicate with each other, often leveraging Spring Cloud components for service discovery, load balancing, and other distributed system patterns. The project structure suggests a separation between "APPS" (individual microservices) and "SERVER" (potentially a discovery server or API Gateway).

### Project Structure

* `APPS/`: Contains individual microservice applications.
* `SERVER/`: Likely contains a discovery service (e.g., Eureka Server) or an API Gateway (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway/Zuul) to manage and route requests to the microservices.

### Built With

* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [Java](https://www.java.com/)
* [Spring Cloud](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud) (for microservices patterns like Eureka, Feign, Gateway, etc.)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (for dependency management)
* *(Optional: Add specific database technologies if individual services use them, e.g., [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/))*
* *(Optional: Mention specific Spring Cloud components like Eureka, Ribbon, Feign, Hystrix, Gateway, Config Server if explicitly used)*

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this Spring Boot Microservices project up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
* Apache Maven (or use the included Maven wrapper)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Pravin-Sonwane-2004/Spring-Boot-Microservices.git](https://github.com/Pravin-Sonwane-2004/Spring-Boot-Microservices.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Spring-Boot-Microservices
    ```
3.  **Build the entire multi-module project:**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    # On Windows, use:
    # mvnw clean install
    ```
    This command will build all services and server modules.

4.  **Configure Application Properties:**
    * Review `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) files within each module's `src/main/resources` folder. You may need to adjust port numbers, service registration details, or database connections based on your local setup.

---

## Usage

To run the microservices application, you typically need to start the "SERVER" component first (e.g., Eureka Server or API Gateway), followed by individual microservices within the "APPS" directory.

### Running Individual Modules

Navigate into each module's directory and run it using the Spring Boot Maven plugin:

1.  **Start the SERVER component first (e.g., if it's a Eureka Server):**
    ```bash
    cd SERVER
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
2.  **Then, start each application within the `APPS` directory:**
    ```bash
    # Example for an app named 'user-service'
    cd ../APPS/user-service
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    Repeat for all other microservice applications in the `APPS` folder.

Once all necessary services are running, you can interact with them via the API Gateway (if present) or by directly hitting the endpoints of individual microservices.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Pravin-Sonwane-2004/Spring-Boot-Microservices/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

* [ ] Implement a service discovery mechanism (e.g., Eureka).
* [ ] Add an API Gateway (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway or Zuul) for routing and filtering requests.
* [ ] Integrate distributed tracing (e.g., Sleuth, Zipkin).
* [ ] Implement centralized configuration (e.g., Spring Cloud Config Server).
* [ ] Add circuit breakers (e.g., Resilience4j, Hystrix).
* [ ] Implement inter-service communication using Feign Client or WebClient.
* [ ] Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for each service.
* [ ] Dockerize each microservice and orchestrate with Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
